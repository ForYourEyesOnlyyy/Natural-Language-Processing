# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Experiments

Welcome to the **NLP Experiments** repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating fundamental NLP techniques, including word embeddings, summarization, named entity recognition (NER), feature engineering, and word sense disambiguation (WSD). Each experiment provides hands-on implementations, evaluations, and best practices for working with text data.

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository covers a range of NLP tasks using classical and modern techniques. The experiments leverage frameworks such as Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, and NLP libraries like spaCy and NLTK.
